* write tests
  
* denodify non-js files
if a file has a non-js extension, recast it, and find the requires and continue
for speed use cache, which is deputy, use fs.stat not mdhash to decide on
whether to (if necessary) recast and parse for requires. So modify deputy. This
is for use in html-builder

* nodejs modules and globals to import:
 https://github.com/substack/node-browserify 
When you require() any of these modules, you will get a browser-specific shim:

assert
buffer
console
constants
crypto
domain
events
http
https
os
path
punycode
querystring
stream
string_decoder
timers
tty
url
util
vm
zlib

Additionally if you use any of these variables, they will be defined in the
bundled output in a browser-appropriate way:

process
Buffer
global - top-level scope object (window)
__filename - file path of the currently executing file
__dirname - directory path of the currently executing file
